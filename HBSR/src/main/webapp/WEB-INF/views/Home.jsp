		<h3>Methodology of HBSR</h3>
		<p>The Research Area Panel on Stroke, NCDIR had approved the
			methodology of the HBSR. The HBSR centre will be one of the major
			hospitals treating stroke patients in the defined geographic area.
			Each HBSR will be lead by Principal Investigator (Neurologist/
			Radiologist/ Medicine/ Intensivist) and Co-PIs from the HBSR centre.
			The HBSR team will collect data on the first &ndash;ever stroke
			patients in a defined population through active case detection in all
			sources of stroke cases - medical institutions, diagnostic centres,
			physiotherapy centres, alternate systems and civil registration
			system for deaths due to stroke.</p>
		<p>These centres will have to provide access to the HBSR Registry
			team to abstract data on the first ever stroke incident patients they
			diagnose, treat or refer. The data is extracted on a standard CORE
			FORM on Stroke Incidence by the HBSR registry team by visiting each
			of the sources according to the frequency of cases reported from the
			centres.</p>
		<p>
			HBSR Team will have to establish linkages with key personnel in
			collaborating institutions.&nbsp;<a

		</p>
		<h3>Data Collection</h3>
		<p>As Stroke is an acute event, data collection has to be real
			time and dynamic. The HBSR Institution will find cases by the
			following methods:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>In a hospital (active case detection)
				<ol>
					<li>Daily review of computer generated hospital and emergency
						department admission registers</li>
					<li>Daily review of acute medical / neurology wards and case
						note review</li>
					<li>Daily review of all case notes of patients dying in
						hospital</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Referrals of possible acute cerebrovascular events by
				clinics, nursing homes, hospitals</li>
			<li>Record finding through
				<ol>
					<li>Twice weekly or Weekly contact of clinics, hospitals,
						nursing homes, local physicians</li>
					<li>Weekly / Monthly contact with relevant departments/
						clinics /health care providers</li>
					<li>Monthly review of hospital discharge data</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>TIA patients in hospitals should be followed up till 24
				hours after onset</li>
			<li>Review of all referrals and case records for brain, carotid,
				or cerebral vascular imaging</li>
			<li>High risk group patients with acute coronary syndrome or an
				acute peripheral vascular event or an elective investigation like
				coronary angiography admitted in the hospital can be followed up</li>
			<li>Verify all medically certified death certificates for
				&lsquo;stroke&rsquo; as a cause of death</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Framework of Registering an first ever incident stroke case</h3>
		<p>WHO definition of stroke is, &ldquo;rapidly developing clinical
			signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function, with
			symptoms lasting 24 hours or longer or leading to death, with no
			apparent cause other than of vascular origin&rdquo;.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Definition of First ever Incident Stroke:</strong>&nbsp;First
			ever (also called "first in a lifetime") refers to people who have
			never had a stroke before. This could present as a Fatal or non Fatal
			stroke event.

		<h3>HBSR CORE FORM</h3>
		<p>
			The HBSR CORE FORM to record incidence has been developed and
			reviewed by the Research Area Panel meetings.&nbsp;<a

			Core Form.

		<h3>Data Transmission and Security</h3>
		<p>Transmission of data has to be done regularly through the
			website www.strokeregistryindia.org. The login ID and password for
			each participating centre will be provided separately. ICMR-NCDIR is
			a custodian of data and shall abide by the ICMR-NCDIR policy on data
			processing and disclosure to ensure a stable, reliable, ethical and
			legally compliant framework for data collection, use and
			dissemination.</p>
		<h3>NCDIR Team Coordination</h3>
		<p>The Coordinating Unit will support individual centres in
			establishing the HBSR in the defined area with inputs in technology,
			epidemiology and field work. NCDIR will support each centre in
			standardizing data collection and verification of duplicates and
			incident mortality matching. The analysis, report preparation and
			publication of the verified / collected pooled data is the
			responsibility of the ICMR-NCDIR, with assistance of the PIs,CO-PIs
			of the participating
			centres.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
